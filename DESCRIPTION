Title: Optimal Selection of SNPs Using a Unified Local Function

Description: Applies a unified local function to select SNPs for low-density 
  SNPs. The method is described in Wu et al. (2020) <doi:10.1111/age.12916>. 
  Briefly, the local function gives different weights to the uniformity (U score) 
  and average Shannon entropy (E score), depending on the inputs of the weights, 
  thus facilitating SNP designs under varied scenarios for low-density SNP chips, 
  including selecting uniformly-distributed SNPs or SNPs with the highest minor 
  allele frequencies. This is an educational version. For more information about 
  this package, please contact Dr. Nick Wu.
